# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
1. The classes CFU was definitely the most challenging. It required a bit of looking online to find what I needed to know to understand the problem and complete it.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
1. Workflow feels great. I'm in a good rhythm and I want to stay ahead of the class and understand everything being thrown at me deeply. 

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
1. How to create classes and methods within the classes. By using attr_reader/accessor it allows us to read and write the values outside of the class.
